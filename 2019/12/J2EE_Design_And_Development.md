企业级应用几乎总是事务的。

EJB CMT事务管理 VS JTA？

Achieve Central Configuration Management:JavaBeanApi,BeanFactory,ApplicationContext

spring is j2ee infrastructure

data access abstraction

The Spring Framework is an open source application framework that aims to make J2EE development
easier

J2EE does a great job of standardizing low-level infrastructure,
solving such problems as how can Java code access transaction management without
dealing with the details of XA transactions. But J2EE does not provide an easily usable
view for application code

Inversion of Control (IoC) and Separation of Concerns (SoC)

programming to interfaces,rather than classes

"How can a J2EE application, written in Java — an OO language — not be OO?

Spring is agile J2EE

Dependency Injection is a form of push configuration.the container "pushes" dependencies into application
objects at runtime. This is the opposite of traditional pull configuration, in which the application object
"pulls" dependencies from its environment. 

Inversion of Control is best understood through the term the "Hollywood Principle,"

Dependency Injection:Setter Injection,Constructor Injection,Method Injection

Dependency Lookup

Spring's choice of unchecked infrastructure exceptions.

Spring provides a proxy-based AOP framework

 the goal is to provide a consistent backbone for application architecture
 
 Transaction management: In general, although business logic can be moved into persistent domain
 objects, transaction management should not be.
 
 Spring is a key part of the brave
 new world of J2EE infrastructure, and application developers are the main beneficiaries.
